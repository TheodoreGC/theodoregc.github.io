<p>My name is Theodore Garson and I am currently working for <a href="https://www.dellemc.com/en-sg/index.htm">Dell</a> as a Principal Software Engineer for the Edge.</p>
<p>I worked previously for the <a href="https://www.sgx.com">Singapore Stock Exchange</a> as a Senior Front-End Engineer for multiple projects such as <a href="https://www.sgx.com">SGX's public website</a> and <a href="https://api2.sgx.com/sites/default/files/2018-05/Titan%20OTC%20Factsheet.pdf">SGX's trade registration platform</a> called <a href="https://titanotc.sgx.com/">Titan OTC</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>I started my IT journey in 2010. Back then, I was working as a SysAdmin for a family business in France. I rapidly switched to Software Engineering which led me to work all around the globe for companies of all shapes. Since then, I have always been searching for new challenges to tackle!</p>
<h2><a id="personal" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#personal"></a>Personal</h2>
<p>I am based in Singapore, where I live since 2016. I love the city so far and enjoy it with my wonderful wife :-)</p>
<p>When I am not hacking around with new technologies, I like to travel and meet new people, try new cuisines of the world and learn more about cultures I am not aware of.</p>
<p>I am also a musician and a sport addict: I play the guitar and I have a black-belt in Judo. I have recently challenged myself to the science of striking as a beginner but motivated Muay Thai boxer.</p>
<h2><a id="hot-topics" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#hot-topics"></a>Hot topics</h2>
<p>One of my main goal for this year is to become proficient in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. I am learning the language and I love it so far.</p>
<p>I have recently started reading <em>Rust for the IoT: Building Internet of Things Apps with Rust and Raspberry Pi</em> by Joseph Faisal Nusairat (available <a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484258590">here</a>). I like to go through the book as I hack my Raspberry Pi at the same time.</p>
<p>I am also learning the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go language</a> and I have an amazing opportunity to do so thanks to my company which is heavily investing in it alongside other tools like <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>.</p>
<p>Productivity-wise, I have started using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> as a personal notes &quot;repository&quot;. This is the tool I use to write the content of this website.</p>
<p>Simply put, Obsidian works with folders of markdown files. It makes it a portable and flexible system open to various processing tools (<em>more on that in an upcoming blog post</em>).</p>
<h2><a id="contact" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#contact"></a>Contact</h2>
<p>If you want to chat with me, the best way is to ping me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodoregarsoncorbeaux/">LinkedIn</a> or send me an <a href="mailto:theodore.corbeaux@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
<p>If you <b><em>must</em></b> call me: first of all, congratulations because I don't share my phone number usually; I will warn you there is a strong likelihood I will not answer the call. If it is something about a project I maintain, please file an issue instead. If if is about a job opportunity, make sure you went through my <a href="./Theodore_GARSON.pdf">resume</a> first.</p>
