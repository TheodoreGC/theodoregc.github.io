# About

My name is Theodore Garson and I am currently working for [Dell](https://www.dellemc.com/en-sg/index.htm) as a Principal Software Engineer for the Edge.

I worked previously for the [Singapore Stock Exchange](https://www.sgx.com) as a Senior Front-End Engineer for multiple projects such as [SGX's public website](https://www.sgx.com) and [SGX's trade registration platform](https://api2.sgx.com/sites/default/files/2018-05/Titan%20OTC%20Factsheet.pdf) called [Titan OTC](https://titanotc.sgx.com/) to name a few.

I started my IT journey in 2010. Back then, I was working as a SysAdmin for a family business in France. I rapidly switched to Software Engineering which led me to work all around the globe for companies of all shapes. Since then, I have always been searching for new challenges to tackle!

## Personal

I am based in Singapore, where I live since 2016. I love the city so far and enjoy it with my wonderful wife :-)

When I am not hacking around with new technologies, I like to travel and meet new people, try new cuisines of the world and learn more about cultures I am not aware of.

I am also a musician and a sport addict: I play the guitar and I have a black-belt in Judo. I have recently challenged myself to the science of striking as a beginner but motivated Muay Thai boxer.

## Hot topics

One of my main goal for this year is to become proficient in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I am learning the language and I love it so far.

I have recently started reading _Rust for the IoT: Building Internet of Things Apps with Rust and Raspberry Pi_ by Joseph Faisal Nusairat (available [here](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484258590)). I like to go through the book as I hack my Raspberry Pi at the same time.

I am also learning the [Go language](https://golang.org/) and I have an amazing opportunity to do so thanks to my company which is heavily investing in it alongside other tools like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Productivity-wise, I have started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a personal notes "repository". This is the tool I use to write the content of this website.

Simply put, Obsidian works with folders of markdown files. It makes it a portable and flexible system open to various processing tools (_more on that in an upcoming blog post_).

## Contact

If you want to chat with me, the best way is to ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodoregarsoncorbeaux/) or send me an [email](mailto:theodore.corbeaux@gmail.com).

If you **_must_** call me: first of all, congratulations because I don't share my phone number usually; I will warn you there is a strong likelihood I will not answer the call. If it is something about a project I maintain, please file an issue instead. If if is about a job opportunity, make sure you went through my [resume](./Theodore_GARSON.pdf) first.
